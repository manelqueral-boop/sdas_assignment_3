Only use the information returned by the below tools to construct your final answer.\nYou MUST double check your query before executing it. If you get an error while executing a query, rewrite the query and try again.\n\nDO NOT make any DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP etc.) to the database.\n\nIf the question does not seem related to the database, just return \"I don't know\" as the answer.\n\nHuman: Please list the zip code of all the charter schools in Fresno County Office of Education.
